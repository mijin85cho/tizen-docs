# Tizen Native APIs

You can develop native applications using the native API modules. You can create diverse applications with a variety of features, and design versatile applications and intriguing user interfaces with text and graphics while taking advantage of many device functionalities, such as sensors and call operations. In addition, you can, for example, manage content and media files, use network and social services, and provide messaging and embedded Web browsing functionality.

The Tizen platform also provides a special kind of native application model, which consists of 1 UI native application and 1 or more native service applications.

The native API specification consists of multiple API modules that represent the versatility and wide variety of features that you can implement in your native application. Each API module represents a set of logically similar submodule APIs which can be grouped into the same category. This structure was designed to make it easier for you to narrow down and find the specific methods that you require to implement a feature in your native application.

There are two types of submodules  - Tizen native modules and open source modules. The integration of open source modules in the native API structure allows you to add additional features by using well-known open source libraries. This is particularly advantageous for developers who are familiar with certain libraries because they can quickly add features and use previously written code in certain cases.

The following table defines the Tizen mobile native API layout. The table describes the API modules and the functionality of all their submodule APIs within that module. The table also acts as a reference source for when you are planning a new feature for your application and need a way to efficiently compare different API modules to decide which APIs to use.

> **Note**  
> Except as noted, the mobile native APIs are available since Tizen 2.3.
