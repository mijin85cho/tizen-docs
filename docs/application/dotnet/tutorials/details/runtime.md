# Managed Runtime Advantages

Managed runtime offers the following advantages to your application development:

- **Faster development**

  Application development is accelerated as the managed runtime handles many functions that otherwise have to be coded into the application. The Tizen Native API and Tizen Web API already provides this benefit.

- **Safer code**

  Managed runtime can handle bound checking, type safety, garbage collection, memory protection services, and objects that are invoked directly. The Tizen Web API already provides some of the benefits mentioned, but does not provide type safety, as JavaScript is not a strongly typed language.

- **Lower deployment costs**

  Component-based architecture makes it easier and faster to deploy applications in an enterprise environment characterized by multiple platforms, devices, and legacy systems.

- **Better quality software**

  Managed runtime helps you to focus on the business logic and the code specific to the application, while reducing the number of errors in the code.

- **Cross-platform support**

  The managed code is portable. Tizen .NET applications can have large portions of their logic applied to other systems supported by the .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms.
